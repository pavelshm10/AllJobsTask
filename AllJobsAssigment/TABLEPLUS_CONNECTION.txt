TablePlus SQL Server Connection Details
========================================

Connection String (Copy this):
Server=localhost,1433;Database=WeatherDB;User Id=sa;Password=YourStrong@Passw0rd;TrustServerCertificate=True;

OR use individual fields:

Connection Type: Microsoft SQL Server
Host/Server: localhost,1433
User/Login: sa
Password: YourStrong@Passw0rd
Database: WeatherDB
Trust Server Certificate: YES/Enabled

Important Notes:
- User MUST be "sa" (lowercase, 2 letters only)
- Password is case-sensitive: YourStrong@Passw0rd
- Host can be "localhost,1433" (with comma) or just "localhost" with port in separate field
- MUST trust/accept the SSL certificate

If TablePlus still shows "Login failed for user '1433'":
- Make sure you're not entering "1433" in the Username/Login field
- The Username/Login field should ONLY contain: sa
- Port goes in the Port field or after hostname with comma: localhost,1433
